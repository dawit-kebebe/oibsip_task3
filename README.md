# Calculator
A simple android calculator app built on java. The project was initiated by an internship opportunity given to me by a company called [OASIS Info Byte](https://oasisinfobyte.com/). This calculator Evaluates a statement given by the user following a BODMAS (PODMAS) rules. As it is explained in the methodologies section of README.md it utilizes the stack data structure heavily. This task is the 3rd task in the list of tasks by [OASIS Info Byte](https://oasisinfobyte.com/).

## Methodologies
This calculator Evaluates a statement given by the user following a BODMAS (PODMAS) rules. Stack data structure is a type of data structure that can be used to evaluate mathematical expressions. Therefore, I heavily utilized the built-in class `Stack` in java to solve problem of following BODMAS rule otherwise.
> ⚠️ **Warning** : The app is new, therefore there might be issues while doing some operations. If you found any issue please don't hesitate to open an issue on this github repository or contact the author.
